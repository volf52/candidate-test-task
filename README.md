 A task meant to test Divly Python developer candidates


### Parsing transactions from CSV
A common task and recurring tasks is to build integrations for importing transactions via csv files from crypto exchanges.
The CSV files are similar in how they list transactions but often have different ways of representing transactions and the data within them.
Some transactions are listed on one row, some on two or more. It's your job to design and build a parsing design that can read and output
the two provided example csv files which represenets two real files from two different crypto exchanges. How a transaction is read
isn't always obvious and how well you figure this out is part of the assesment in the test.

Note that the amounts and values are made up and does not reflect actual currency values of the dates they were made.


### Input
The `CSVParser` class takes a path to a csv file as input.

### Requirements
- You must use Python 3.x
- You must use the `pandas` library
- You must be able to parse all existing transactions in the the two different example files.
- The `CSVParser` class must be used for printing the results as already written in `main.py`. Aside from that you may design and structure other functions, classes or data structures exactly how you see fit and think is best. Your design choices are at the core of how we evaluate your test.

### Expected output
To store a transaction in the database the output needs to be in json as below. For each transaction 
that is parsed, the expected output should be as the below for each of the transactin types. You may show the results simply by printing it
using the `print_results()` method in the `CSVParser` class found in `main.py`. Note that there are three different transaction types and how they differ in their output format is shown below.


#### Example output:

**Trade**:

 ```javascript
 {
     'date':'yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm',
     'transaction_type':'Trade',
     'received_amount': 20
     'received_currency_iso': 'BTC'
     'sent_amount': 100
     'sent_currency_iso': 'USD'
 }

```

**Deposit**:

 ```javascript
 {
     'date':'yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm',
     'transaction_type':'Deposit',
     'received_amount': 20,
     'received_currency_iso': 'BTC',
     'sent_amount': null,
     'sent_currency_iso': null,
 }

```

**Withdrawal**:

 ```javascript
 {
     'date':'yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm',
     'transaction_type':'Withdrawal',
     'received_amount': null,
     'received_currency_iso': null,
     'sent_amount': 20,
     'sent_currency_iso': 'BTC',
 }

```

#### Transaction types

`transaction_type` is a text string and must be one of these three in the output:

1. `Trade` - One currency is traded for another currency in an account.
2. `Deposit` - An increase of crypto to an account.
3. `Withdrawal` - A decrease of crypto to n account.


### What we asses in your code test:
 - How well your chosen design the parser for scale
 - How easy the design and code is to understand
 - How well the design works if we would like to add more files in the future.
 - How well you understand how transactions should be interpreted without explicit instructions on what the file lists (as it will be in the real world.)
 - How Pythonic the code style is (not super important)

 Good luck!
